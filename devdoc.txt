# DESIGN DOCUMENT: Case Worker - The Cream City Chronicles

## 1. Core Philosophy & Tone
* **Genre:** Satirical RPG / Survival Horror (Bureaucracy Edition).
* **Vibe:** "Eldritch Bureaucracy." The system is a monster, the city is chaotic neutral, and the player is just trying to pay rent.
* **The Golden Rule:** We mock the system, the weather, and the infrastructure, but we **respect the people** (mostly). The Milverine is God. Kennedy is the Devil/Savior.

---

## 2. The Pantheon (Lore)

### The Milverine (The Paladin of Pavement)
* **Role:** The Divine Protector.
* **Lore:** He who walks shirtless in the winter. He represents physical endurance and the spirit of "Just Keep Moving."
* **Mechanic:** *Divine Intervention.* If Player HP hits 0 or Stress hits 100, 5% chance he appears, nods, and fully heals the player.
* **Flavor Text:** *"The clouds part. A brisk walker approaches. He is shirtless. He is glorious. He does not stop for the red light; the red light stops for him."*

### Kennedy (The Sorceress of the System)
* **Role:** The Eldritch Bureaucrat.
* **Lore:** A multi-armed entity of pure administration. She exists in the "Cloud." She solves problems not by fixing them, but by filing them away so deep they no longer exist.
* **Mechanic:** *The Summoning.* Requires "Ancient Coffee" and "Forbidden Form 1040-X" at the Central Library. Grants "Administrative Override" (Instant Kill).
* **Flavor Text:** *"She floats above the desk, illuminated by the hum of fluorescent lights. 'Per my last email,' she chants, and reality bends."*

## 3. The Map & Neighborhood Logic
*Instruction for Coders: Each location needs a Description, a Danger Level (1-5), Neighbors (connections), and a Landmark.*

| Neighborhood | Description (Flavor Text) | Key Landmark | Unique Hazard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Downtown** | "Skyscrapers, sadness, and wind tunnels. The heart of the beast." | Central Library (Kennedy Summoning) | **The Bridge:** Randomly opens, trapping you for 20 mins (+Stress). |
| **Polonia** (South Side) | "The Basilica looms. Smells like incense, old bricks, and pierogis." | Basilica of St. Josaphat | **Bell Ringing:** Too loud. +2 Stress. |
| **Riverwest** | "Alleys, art, anarchy. Everyone looks like they play bass." | Falcon Bowl | **The Vortex:** You stop for one drink, you stay for six. (-Time). |
| **West Allis** | "The Holy Land. Questionable lawn ornaments and honest people." | West Allis Cheese Shoppe | **Nostalgia Trap:** You get stuck listening to a story about 1982. |
| **Bay View** | "Hipster parents pushing $800 strollers to buy $9 donuts." | The Vanguard | **Price Shock:** Everything costs 20% more here. |
| **Sherman Park** | "Historic boulevards and the best neighbors." | Sherman Phoenix | **Potholes:** Actual HP damage if you trip. |
| **The Center** | "The Coggs Center. The fluorescent lights hum with malice." | Economic Support Window | **The Queue:** High Stress damage every turn. |

## 5. The Combat System (Satire)
*Instruction for Coders: Do not use "Attack" or "Defense." Use the following terminology.*

**Player Moves:**
1.  **Malicious Compliance:** "You follow the rules so precisely it causes the enemy to crash." (Crit vs. Bureaucracy types).
2.  **Weaponized Apathy:** "You stare blankly. The enemy feels awkward and leaves." (Crit vs. Emotional types).
3.  **Jargon Overload:** "You say 'Synergy', 'Circle Back', and 'Touch Base' rapidly." (Crit vs. Corporate types).
4.  **The "Ope":** (Defensive Move) "You say 'Ope, just gonna sneak past ya.' Dodge chance increased."

**Enemy Moves:**
1.  **"Please Hold":** Stuns the player for 1 turn.
2.  **"Fax Required":** heavy Stress damage.
3.  **"Passive Aggressive Note":** Low damage, but lowers player Morale.
